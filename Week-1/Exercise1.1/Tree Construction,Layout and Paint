The CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a render tree, which is then used to compute the layout of each visible element and serves as an input to the 
paint process that renders the pixels to screen. Optimizing each of these steps is critical to achieving optimal rendering performance.

In the previous section on constructing the object model, we built the DOM and the CSSOM trees based on the HTML and CSS input. However, both of these are
independent objects that capture different aspects of the document: one describes the content, and the other describes the style rules that need to be 
applied to the document.

TL;DR #
The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree.
Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.
Layout computes the exact position and size of each object.
The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen.
First, the browser combines the DOM and CSSOM into a "render tree," which captures all the visible DOM content on the page and all the CSSOM style 
information for each node.
