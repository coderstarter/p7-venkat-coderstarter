The script processor executes Javascript code to process an event. The processor uses a pure Go implementation of ECMAScript 5.1 and has no external
dependencies. This can be useful in situations where one of the other processors doesnâ€™t provide the functionality you need to filter events.

The processor can be configured by embedding Javascript in your configuration file or by pointing the processor at external file(s).

processors:
  - script:
      lang: javascript
      source: >
        function process(event) {
            event.Tag("js");
        }
        
        
This loads filter.js from disk.

processors:
  - script:
      lang: javascript
      file: ${path.config}/filter.js
