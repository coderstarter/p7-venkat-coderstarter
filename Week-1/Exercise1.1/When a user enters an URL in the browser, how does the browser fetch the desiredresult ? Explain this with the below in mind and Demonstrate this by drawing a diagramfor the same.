Question : When a user enters an URL in the browser, how does the browser fetch the desiredresult ?
Answer : 
        URL stands for Uniform Recource Locator
        A URL is the address of the website which we can find in the adress bar of your browser. It is a reference on the internet, be it images, hypertext
        pages, audio/video etc.

        Example : https://www.apple.com

        DNS came into picture, when we put a URL in address bar of browser.
        DNS stands for Domain Name system. It maintain and maps the name of website which is URL and particular IP address it links to it. Every URL on the internet
        has a unique IP address which is of the computer which hosts the server of the website requested.

        For Example:
            When you point your browser at a URL like https://uselessiphones.com, your browser has to figure out which server on the Internet 
            is hosting the site. It does this by looking up the domain, uselessiphones.com, to find the address.

        Each device on the Internet — servers, cell phones, your smart refrigerator — all have a unique address called an IP address. An IP address
        contains four numbered parts:

        203.0.113.0

        But numbers like this are hard to remember! That’s where domain names come in. uselessiphones.com is much easier to remember than 203.0.113.0,

        Imagine having to remember all the phone numbers of your contacts without having the Contacts app on your phone. Your Contacts app lets you look 
        up phone numbers by name.
        We do the same on the Internet. The domain name system, or DNS, is like the Contacts app on our phone. DNS helps our browser (and us) find servers
        on the Internet. We can do a DNS lookup to find the IP address of the server based on the domain name.
        
        Background Process when we search a query or enters a URL
        1. Browser checks cache for DNS entry to find the corresponding IP address of website.
        It looks for following cache. If not found in one, then continues checking to the next until found.
            Browser Cache
            Operating Systems Cache
            Router Cache
            ISP Cache

        2. If not found in cache, ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) DNS server initiates a DNS query to find IP address of server that hosts the domain 
        name. The requests are sent using small data packets that contain information content of request and IP address it is destined for.

        3. Browser initiates a TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) connection with the server using synchronize(SYN) and acknowledge(ACK) messages.
        4. Browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. GET or POST request.
        5. Server on the host computer handles that request and sends back a response. It assembles a response in some format like JSON, XML and HTML.
        6. Server sends out an HTTP response along with the status of response.
        7. Browser displays HTML content
        8. Finally, Done.
