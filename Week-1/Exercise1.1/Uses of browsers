A web browser, also known as a “browser,” is an application software that allows users to find, access, display, and view websites. Microsoft Internet
Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari are all popular web browsers.

Web browsers are primarily used to display and access websites on the internet, as well as other content created with programming languages such as 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) (XML). Browsers convert Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web pages and websites 
into human-readable content. They can also show other protocols and prefixes, such as secure HTTP (HTTPS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), email handling
(mailto:), and files (file:).

A web browser’s primary function is to render HTML, the code that is used to design or “mark up” web pages. When a browser loads a web page, it processes
the HTML, which may contain text, links, and references to images and other items like CSS and JavaScript functions. The browser then renders these objects
in the browser window after processing them.
